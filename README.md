# PixelmonOverlay
This plugin lets you send preconfigurated announcements through the Pixelmon's Notice Overlay (topbar).

![](https://github.com/happyzleaf/PixelmonOverlayBroadcaster/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

PlaceholderAPI is supported but optional. However, you won't be able to retrieve any information without it, not even the player's name.

Usage
-
1. Launch the server with the plugin.
2. Modify the messages in ` /config/pixeloverlaybroadcaster.conf` according to the [these](#config) values.
3. ???
4. Profit.

Config
-
`broadcastInterval` (defaults to 300 seconds) sets the interval after which the announcement will change.

`silenceInterval` (defaults to 300 seconds) sets the time to wait between two announcements. Set to 0 to disable.

`announcements` contains the ordered list of all the (guess what?) announcements. They will be shown according to their position in the list.

Node|Values|Meaning
---|---|---
`layout`|`LEFT_AND_RIGHT`, `LEFT` or `RIGHT`.|Specifies the position of the sprite.
`lines`|List of strings. |Sets the lines to be shown to the player. [Formatting codes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/g00/Formatting_codes?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLml0Lw%3D%3D&i10c.ua=1&i10c.dv=14) and [placeholders](https://github.com/rojo8399/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders) are supported.
`duration`|Decimal number. Example `20`|How long this announcement will last for. If not present, `broadcastInterval` will be used instead.
`type`|`PokemonSprite`, `Pokemon3D`, `ItemSprite`, `Item3D`|Specifies the type of the sprite, read below for more info.
`spec`|[Pok√©mon's spec](https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/index.php?title=Pokemon_spec). Example: `pikachu s`|Required by `PokemonSprite` and `Pokemon3D`, specifies the pok√©mon's info.
`itemStack`|The ItemStack.|Required by `ItemStack`, specifies the itemstack.

Restrictions
-
I fixed a lot of stuff, but also implemented new bugsüòÖ. There are some problems with the colors of the window, I'll fix them for Pixelmon 7.0.4.
However, you can now use any kind of item and pok√©mon, as long as the client knows how to render them, and `scale` has been removed, you can change their size through the growth's pok√©mon spec, like `gr:giant` to make them bigger, and `gr:microscopic` to make them smaller.

You can use the character `&` to style your lines with colors and formattings, while to use the character `&` normally you have to escape it by placing `\\` before. For example, `&1Pikachu \\& Solgaleo` will print a blue (`&1`) string saying `Pikachu & Solgaleo`.

API
-
I split the plugin to api and implementation, and now other plugins can use the Pixelmon Notice Overlay to show off messages and custom announcements.

Example:
```java
OverlayService service = Sponge.getServiceManager().provideUnchecked(OverlayService.class);

Overlay overlay = service.create([...]);
service.show(overlay);
```
This might seem confusing, I'll update the thread with the link to the docs as soon as I finish writing them.
